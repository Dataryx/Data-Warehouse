## üéì Understanding the Scope

### This is a GRADUATE-LEVEL Project

**What this means:**
- It's challenging but achievable
- Designed for one semester (14-16 weeks)
- Requires 15-20 hours per week
- Expected to demonstrate:
  - Technical competence across multiple domains
  - Problem-solving ability
  - Integration skills
  - Professional documentation

**What it's NOT:**
- Not a research-level PhD project
- Not a production system for a company
- Not beyond graduate capabilities
- Not impossible with the provided guidance

### Core vs Optional Features

**Core (MUST HAVE):**
‚úÖ Working data warehouse with sample data  
‚úÖ 3-4 ML models (Query Cost Predictor, Workload Forecaster, Index Recommender)  
‚úÖ Backend API with optimization  
‚úÖ Frontend dashboard with real-time updates  
‚úÖ Documentation and demo  

**Optional (NICE TO HAVE):**
‚≠ê Additional ML models (Query Clustering, Resource Allocator)  
‚≠ê Advanced visualizations  
‚≠ê Docker deployment  
‚≠ê Advanced monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana)  

**If you're running short on time**: Focus on core features and do them excellently rather than trying to implement everything partially.

### 4. **Document as You Go**
- Don't leave documentation for the end
- Take screenshots during development
- Keep notes on challenges and solutions
- Document decisions

### 5. **Test Continuously**
- Test each component before moving on
- Don't let bugs accumulate
- Fix issues immediately
- Maintain a working system

### 6. **Ask for Help When Stuck**
- Don't spend more than 2 hours stuck on one issue

   - You'll accumulate technical debt
   
5. **Leave documentation for the end**
   - You'll forget important details
   
6. **Work without a backup/version control**
   - Use Git from day 1
   
7. **Aim for perfection on first try**
   - Iterate and improve

### ‚úÖ DO:
1. **Read all documentation first**
2. **Follow phases sequentially**
3. **Update checklist regularly**
4. **Test after each major change**
5. **Document continuously**
